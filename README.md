# CESM2-Large-Ensemble
# Written by Ji-Eun Kim

The CESM2 Large Ensemble dataset is produced by the IBS Center for Climate Physics in South Korea 
in collaboration with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in the USA. 
It comprises 100 ensemble members at a spatial resolution of 1 degree, 
spanning the period from 1850 to 2100 under CMIP6 historical and SSP370 future climate forcing scenarios.
